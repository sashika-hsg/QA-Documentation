# Test Governance & Decision Framework

## Purpose
This document defines the **QA-led test governance and decision-making framework** used to ensure quality, risk visibility, and accountability across the delivery lifecycle.

It establishes **clear ownership, decision rights, escalation paths, and quality gates**, enabling informed and confident decisions in complex, multi-team, and regulated environments.

---

## Scope
This framework applies to:
- All delivery initiatives and releases
- Feature, enhancement, and defect-driven work
- Multi-team environments (Frontend, Backend, ML)
- Programs operating with evolving or incomplete requirements
- Regulated or risk-sensitive systems

---

## Governance Principles

- **Quality is a shared responsibility**, but governance must have a clear owner
- **Decisions must be evidence-based**, not assumption-driven
- **Risk must be visible, documented, and owned**
- **Speed does not override clarity**
- **QA enables decisions — it does not silently approve risk**

---

## Governance Model Overview

The governance model ensures that **quality decisions are made at the right time, by the right people, using the right information**.
